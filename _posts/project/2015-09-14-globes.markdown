#Globes

###Time-lapse
I took a series of 360x180 spherical panoramas at Picnic Point in Madison at sunset. In high light levels I use high speed bursts of photos, like a low frame rate movie. Stitching the photos becomes very simple with so many photos. In low light, the images blur making it harder to stitch. Next time I do a low light panorama I'll try a different tecnique.

These images were created using PTGui and Photoshop:
