###Outline: In Progress

<b>Self-driving cars</b> are the future.


####I don't like the loss of control.
* How do you feel about riding in a taxi, or a bus, or when your fried gives you a ride?
    * You don't have direct control of the car.
    * Once you trust the vehicle to respond to your concerns or handle them without intervention, it wins.

####What if something jumps in front of the car?
* What would you do?
    * Sometimes things are just unavoidable
* How is this system superior?
    * Much faster reaction time
    * More types of sensors

####What if it loses control/makes a mistake/gets hacked?
* Again, people make mistakes, too
* How is this system superior?
    * Never tired, always focused

####Benefits
* efficient
    * gas economy
    * human productivity
